<p>
After cold emailing over 40 labs internationally, I connected with the Computational Biology and Complex Systems Lab in Barcelona. With support from a $10,000 Northwestern grant, I used the opportunity to dive into computational research for the first time and get a more global perspective on how research is conducted. My work focused on atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias, and how disruptions in intracellular signaling could increase disease risk. I helped model the cAMP-PDE signaling pathway in atrial myocytes using MATLAB, with an emphasis on understanding the genetic risk variant rs13143308T that’s been linked to abnormal calcium levels in the heart.

I designed differential equations that represented how molecules like adenosine receptors, cyclic AMP, and phosphodiesterases interact to control calcium concentrations in heart cells. These calcium levels are a major factor in arrhythmia development. By running different simulations and testing how changes in protein concentrations affected the system, I was able to predict how this AF risk variant alters cellular behavior, even in subtle, non-obvious ways. From this project, I was able to see how computational models can help uncover the “hidden layers” of disease, which later inspired my future work.
