Hi!!! I’m Sammy, a 23-year-old currently based in Brooklyn, working at the intersection of research, computational tools, and social impact. After years in academic research, I stepped back to apply my technical and creative skills toward using AI to better understand and address the often overlooked drivers of inequities, primarily within the healthcare and research setting. 

Right now, I’m building my startup, Bond Health. Alongside my co-founders, we’re building proprietary LLMs and ML models to revolutionize how academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies recruit patients. This idea came from my personal frustration with how little of my research generalized to the populations that needed it most. There’s an abundance of data in medical records that can be used to personalize and fix the inefficient, expensive, and exclusive process of clinical trial recruitment. With $150K+ in funding, we are currently running pilots to show that bringing trials to the patient is not only possible but can be done while navigating the legal, regulatory, and privacy challenges that have stalled this solution for years.

I recently completed my Master’s in Biomedical Informatics from Harvard Medical School. While in Boston, I conducted computational research across Mass General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard Law School all focused on uncovering, addressing, and preventing inequities in healthcare. Before that, I studied Biology, Data Science, and Linguistics at Northwestern University while conducting in vivo and in vitro research. As part of the Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME), Northwestern’s BS/MD program with the Feinberg School of Medicine, I deferred my matriculation to continue pursuing my research and technical work.

Beyond my own projects, I’ve also advised initiatives using AI to tackle complex problems, from helping secure venture capital for a platform empowering breast cancer patients to make personalized treatment decisions, to developing pricing strategies for an AIoT startup optimizing industrial fluid dynamics for sustainability. While I’ve enjoyed leading my own work, I’ve found that collaborating and supporting others through the potential of AI is often the most powerful way to drive impact.

Outside of work, you can find me biking along the riverside, photographing my friends, bouldering to some neo-soul, or propagating and gifting my pothos. Please feel free to email me any good overnight oats recipes you know of.
