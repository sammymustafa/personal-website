I’m a researcher who designs, builds, and directs AI technologies to uncover and resolve the hidden influences behind social inequities, primarily in the healthcare landscape. I just finished my Master’s in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and am now pioneering new ways to improve both diversity and efficiency in clinical trial recruitment. Please look around to learn more about me and my work!
