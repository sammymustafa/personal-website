I’m a researcher at heart who designs, builds, and guides AI solutions that address critical blind spots driving social inequities, mainly in the healthcare landscape. I just finished my Master’s in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and am now pioneering new ways to improve both diversity and efficiency in clinical trial recruitment. Please look around to learn more about me and my work!
